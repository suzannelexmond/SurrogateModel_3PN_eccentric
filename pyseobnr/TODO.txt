- instead of cutting waveforms, change freqmin for every waveform so it is all same length (much faster)
- change waveform size to time in [M]
- test greedy algorithm (differen strategy?)
- integrate chi, rel_anomaly and deltaT in all classes

Last time (06/06/2025):
- Somehow the image folder for EMp nodes don't appear eventough it said the images are saved. 
I tried to alter the emperical nodes code to make it more efficient, but it doesnt work yet
I tried it out by adding a _test function, but it already errors in the normal function I don't think I changed.
