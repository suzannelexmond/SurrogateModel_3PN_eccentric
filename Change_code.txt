- Change class that only function in geom to not include total mass and lum_dist
- In training set class, just call the simulate inspiral and waveform properties classes instead of inheritence, so no class objects have to be included in training set class.
- Put all long lines of class inheritence in rows for clearence
- Make siminspiral_mass_indp and mass_depd 1 function
- change amount input waveforms to 500 or something and see what greedy algorithm does
- Train the time-domain for much lower f_lower so there's more time-domain available also for high eccentric classes
- Build Juan's hyperparameter training algorithm for optimisation of the N_greedy vecs and input_vecs
