- Input parameters class (ecc_min, ecc_max, t_ref, amount of wfs OR greedy_errors, M_total, amount of wfs in surrogate)
- calculate things like self.parameterspace, f_ref, 
- Save greedy_parameters and time_node_idx
- First build code, than save all extra data to files and make func for this
- make seperate functons for example emp nodes and greedy basis and use 1 function to to step after step, but not insert everything into next function
- make sim_inspiral independent (h/r)
- make Sim_inspiral objects with function and use these objects for polarizations and residuals
- Use normalised waveforms in thesis?
