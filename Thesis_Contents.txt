1. Introduction

    - Linearized gravity and gauge transformations
    - Production of Gravitational Waves
    - Quadrupolar radiation
    - Post-Newtonian expansion
        - Higher order expansion of metric --> templates (matched filtering)
    
    - Energy loss due to Gravitational Radiation
    - Detection of Gravitational Waves
        - detection sources
        
    - why do we use surrogate models?
    - accuracy/precision
    
2. Eccentric BBH systems
    - Binary black hole mergers
    - From inspiral to coalescence
    - Defining eccentricity
    - Why do we look at eccentric cases?
    - Waveforms in terms of Sperical Harmonics
    - Eccentric Newtonian/Post-Newtonian waveforms

3. Fast prediction of gravitational waveforms using surrogate models

    - 























2. SimInspiralTD
    - How does it generate h_+ and h_x
    - What are the limitations?
    - high eccentricity --> f_ISCO is really different
    - low eccentricity --> doesn't generate 0 eccentricity
    - What are the specifics of the waveform? 2,2 mode, time-domain

3. Different modes?
