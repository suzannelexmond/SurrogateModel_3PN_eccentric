1. Introduction

    - Linearized gravity and gauge transformations
    
    In general relativity, the Einstein field equations describe the behavior or the gravitational field.
    The field equations are a set of highly nonlinear equations. However, assuming the perturbations are small,
    we can approximate the field equations in a linear way, neglecting higher order terms. 
    This is a reasonable approximation for late stage gravitational waves signals detected by GW detectors, where the waves are weak and weel-described by linear perturbation theory.

    gravitational waves can be described as small perturbations in the curvature of space-time
    --> g = eta + h,
    where eta is the background metric in teh absence of a gravitational source and h is the space-time perturbation.

    The linearized field equations can be computed with the Ricci Tensor

2. SimInspiralTD
    - How does it generate h_+ and h_x
    - What are the limitations?
    - high eccentricity --> f_ISCO is really different
    - low eccentricity --> doesn't generate 0 eccentricity
    - What are the specifics of the waveform? 2,2 mode, time-domain

3. Different modes?
